# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
This project focuses on customer care calls from the insurance category in ABC company. 
The objective is to analyze these calls over a full day to determine various metrics, such as the average number of calls, total call volume, abandon rate, and the number of additional agents required to ensure a positive customer experience. 
For this project, I have taken the approach of using Microsoft Excel to create a pivot table that summarizes the call volume data by different categories such as date, time of day, call type, etc. This will allow you to easily analyze the trends and patterns in the call volume over time. Next, I have used assumptions about the call volume trends to estimate how many people are required for night shifts. For example, if the call volume tends to peak during certain times of the day, you can assume that more people will be needed during those times.
